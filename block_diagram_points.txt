Main Points for the Block Diagram of the Resume Classifier Project:

1. User Interface (UI)
   - Input area for pasting resumes.
   - Button to submit the resume for classification.
   - Display area for results.

2. Backend Processing
   - Data Preprocessing
     - Text cleaning and tokenization.
     - TF-IDF vectorization of the cleaned text.
   - Model Training
     - Loading the pre-trained model.
     - Classifying the input resume using the model.

3. Model
   - SVC (Support Vector Classifier) model trained on labeled data.
   - Class weights to handle imbalanced classes.

4. Output
   - Displaying the predicted job title or classification result.

5. Dependencies
   - Libraries used (e.g., Pandas, NLTK, Scikit-learn).
