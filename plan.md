Here is the comprehensive plan for executing the task of integrating a URL for resume review and job market analysis:

### Information Gathered:
- The `job_market_analysis.py` file currently makes a hardcoded API request to fetch salary data for a specific job title at a specific company. This needs to be modified to accept dynamic parameters.
- The `app.py` file contains the main Flask application logic, including routes for job market analysis and resume review. The `/job_market_analysis` route will be updated to handle user input for company name and job title.
- The `/resume_review` route will be updated to accommodate any new functionality related to resume review.

### Plan:
1. **Update `job_market_analysis.py`**:
   - Modify the script to accept dynamic parameters (company name, job title) from user input instead of hardcoding them.

2. **Update `app.py`**:
   - Modify the `/job_market_analysis` route to accept query parameters for company name and job title.
   - Ensure that the API request in this route uses the dynamic parameters provided by the user.
   - Review the `/resume_review` route to ensure it can handle any new functionality related to resume review.

3. **Update HTML Templates**:
   - Modify `templates/job_market_analysis.html` to include a form for users to input the company name and job title.
   - Ensure that the form submits the data to the `/job_market_analysis` route.
   - Review `templates/resume_review.html` to ensure it meets the requirements for the resume review functionality.

### Follow-up Steps:
- Test the updated functionality to ensure that the job market analysis works with dynamic inputs.
- Verify that the resume review functionality is functioning as expected.
