# 12 Week Project Progress Report

## Week 1
### Study Plan
- Discussed the project goals, scope, and structure with the team.
- Researched various techniques for resume classification.
- Created a detailed flowchart representing the application workflow.
- Listed and finalized all software requirements needed for implementation.

### Discussion
- Discussed project objectives, focusing on resume review and job market analysis.
- Identified the necessary components for integrating classification models.
- Discussed and finalized the application’s architecture with all team members.
- Ensured that everyone understood their roles in implementing the GUI.

### Plan for Next Week
- Research text preprocessing, TF-IDF, and machine learning models for resume classification and job search APIs for retrieving job data.
- Begin developing the graphical user interface (GUI) using Flask and frontend technologies.
- Set up Flask routes to handle user input and API responses.

## Week 3
### Study Plan
- Explored frontend integration with Flask backend to connect user inputs with logic.
- Developed the frontend structure using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Studied different text preprocessing techniques for resume classification.
- Implemented TF-IDF vectorization and integrated it with the SVM model using 5-fold cross-validation.

### Discussion
- Discussed the progress of frontend development and addressed UI-related challenges.
- Ensured the frontend forms correctly sent data to the Flask backend.
- Finalized the implementation of the model and ensured that it produced accurate predictions based on resume data.
- Integrated a contact form to receive user feedback via email.

### Plan for Next Week
- Begin implementing text preprocessing and TF-IDF in Flask application
- Connect the trained model with the backend API and ensure proper integration.
- Test the Flask API endpoints for receiving and processing user resumes.
