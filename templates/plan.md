### Comprehensive Plan for Executing the Task

1. **Information Gathered:**
   - The `index.html` file serves as the main entry point for the web application, containing various sections such as the header, hero section, features, job market analysis, contact information, and modals for user interactions.
   - The layout is responsive and utilizes CSS variables for styling, ensuring a modern and visually appealing design.

2. **Proposed Updates:**
   - **Enhance User Experience:**
     - Add tooltips or additional information for buttons and features to guide users.
     - Implement smooth scrolling for navigation links to improve usability.

     - Ensure all images and icons have appropriate `alt` attributes for screen readers.
     - Review color contrast ratios to ensure readability for users with visual impairments.
   - **Performance Optimization:**
     - Minimize CSS and JavaScript files to improve load times.
     - Consider lazy loading images and other resources to enhance performance.

3. **Dependent Files to be Edited:**
   - `static/style.css`: For any necessary CSS adjustments.
   - `static/script.js`: For adding any new JavaScript functionality related to user interactions.

4. **Follow-up Steps:**
